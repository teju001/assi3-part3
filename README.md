Part 3 XML (Programming - JAVA or Python):
I created an XML file. In this document, I modeled a object I wanted. To validate my XML document, I created a Schema and DTD. To parse and validate my XML document against the Schema, I wrote a JAVA XML DOM parser. I used standard JAVA library packages and instaled libraries. DomParserSchema. To parse and validate my XML document against the DTD, I wrote a JAVA XML DOM parser. The parser source code file was named DomParserDTD Finally, I got the output Iâ€™m expecting,then recorded and uploaded the code to github
